### **Frontend Documentation: E-Commerce Website CRUD Operations**

#### 1. **Introduction**  
The frontend of the e-commerce website is built using React, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It provides an intuitive and responsive user interface for users to browse products, add them to the cart, and manage their orders seamlessly.

#### 2. **Technologies Used**  
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the component-based structure.  
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-styled components.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For dynamic behavior and interactivity.  
- **CSS/SCSS**: For custom styling.

#### 3. **Features**  
- **Product Listing**: Displays products with details such as name, price, and description.  
- **Add to Cart**: Allows users to add products to their cart with real-time updates.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete items in their shopping cart.  
- **User Authentication**: Integration of login and signup pages for secure access.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various screen sizes.

#### 4. **Folder Structure  
- **/src/components: Contains reusable React components (e.g., Navbar, ProductCard).  
- **/src/pages: Main pages like Home, Cart, ProductDetails, and Checkout.  
- **/src/assets: Images, icons, and other static assets.  
- **/src/styles: Custom stylesheets for enhancing the UI.

5. Key Functionalities  
- State Management: Uses React’s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state.  
- Routing: React Router is used for navigating between different pages.  
- API Integration: Fetches product data from the backend using `axios` or `fetch`.  
- Form Validation: Ensures proper input handling for forms like login, signup, and checkout.

6. Conclusion  
The frontend is designed to deliver a smooth and engaging user experience. Future improvements could include better UI animations, advanced search features, and optimized mobile responsiveness.
